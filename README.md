# Assignment-Two: Storytelling Remixed
*Due 10.13 by 11:59pm*

Visualizations are often embedded in narrative pieces in journalism, education, and elsewhere to provide people with data to support a given argument or explanation. These visualizations are often static, but many times are interactive to support people in working with the data to build their own conclusions through the visualization. Such techniques are intended to increase a reader’s agency---their sense of control and autonomy---in understanding the material and, as a result, increase reader trust. 

For this assignment, you will be asked to remix a data story. Find a narrative online that uses data to explain something or to argue a specific point. These articles may or may not include visualizations. Good starting sources include 538, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, but you are by no means limited to these outlets. Provide a link somewhere in your document to the original piece and make sure to credit the original authors somewhere in your assignment. 

Once you’ve found a story you wish to work with, you’ll remix that story. You can remix your story in any way you want (e.g., you can add/remove/edit the prose or integrate or remove visualizations). However, I will be looking for the following elements in your remix: 
<ul>
<li> Your story should stand alone as an independent piece. That is, you should create either a notebook or single webpage that contains your story and includes all relevant text and visualizations.</li>   
<li>	Your story should include at least three visualizations, using noticeably different designs (e.g., more than just changing the color scheme in your scatterplots). </li>
<li> At least one of your visualizations should be interactive and generated using Altair or Vega-Lite. You can either build that visualization in-line (e.g., in a notebook) or by exporting the visualization and embedding it in your webpage. You can build the remaining visualizations using whatever tools you’d prefer, but they should reflect your own designs (e.g., not the Tableau defaults).</li>
<li>	Your visualizations should blend with the text of the story to support the presented arguments or explanations. Note that you can add, remove, or update the text to match your visualizations. </li>
<li>	Your data source should be cited somewhere in the piece. Note that not all stories will do this (however, it is good practice to provide transparency into your data whenever possible) and that you do not have to use the same data source as the original story. </li>
</ul>

The rubric for this assignment is as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Story and data are cited & original authors credited: 5 pts</li>
<li> Visualizations (36 pts total, 12pts each): </li>
<ul>
<li>	Visualizations reflect the intended story: 6 pts</li>
<li>	Visualizations are thoughtfully designed: 6 pts</li>
</ul>
<li>	-12pts if no visualizations are constructed using Altair or Vega-Lite. </li>
<li>	-12pts if none of the visualizations are interactive. </li>
<li>	Visualizations are integrated with the text & stands as an independent piece: 9pts (3 pts each)</li>
</ul>

## Bells & Whistles (Extra Credit):

*Live Deployment (2pts):* Deploy your story as part of a live web portfolio. Provide a link to that portfolio somewhere in your submission document. 

*View Coordination (3pts):* Your stories will likely all relate to the same general set of ideas, often building on one another to steadily explain an idea or argument. To help clarify these arguments, design your visualizations to interact with one another using view coordination. That is, interacting with one visualization will cause a change in another. 

*Multiple Views (5pts):* The same data can be used to argue two sides of the same story. Use your visualizations and story to provide a counter-argument to the original story. Your text should explicitly discuss your counterargument in the context of the original story and use the visualizations to refute the original argument.
